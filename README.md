# Shopping Cart
This is a very basic react native web application. <br>
I have used react native managed by expo and redux <br>

## Follow the below procedure to run the application
### Download the source code and extract it.
### Open with any code editor - VS code is preferrable.
### Make sure have installed node in your system, min node-version req is 10.19.0 for this application.
### Install expo-cli using the below cmd
    npm install -g expo-cli
### Install the packages required by using the below command.
    npm install
### To run the application use
    expo start --web

## Now your own Shopping Cart is ready to use.....:-)
